<p>I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona. I am
working as a graduate research assistant with Prof. Beichuan Zhang
and my field of research mainly focuses on Named-Data Networking
(NDN) project which is one of the promising architectures of the
future Internet. Currently, I am working on designing and implementing
a new Content Distribution Network (CDN) over information-centric
communication model.

We recently deployed the first adaptive video streaming service over NDN
for daily Internet users. You can enjoy watching videos over NDN on the
[project's website](https://ivisa.named-data.net).</p>
