<p>I am a 4th year Ph.D. student at the University of Arizona. I am
working as a graduate research assistant with <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~bzhang">Prof. Beichuan Zhang</a>
and my field of research mainly focuses on <a href="https://named-data.net">Named-Data Networking</a>
(NDN) project which is one of the promising architectures of the
future Internet. Currently, I am working on designing and implementing
a new Content Distribution Network (CDN) over information-centric
communication model.</p>
</br>
<p>We recently deployed the first adaptive video streaming service over NDN
for daily Internet users. You can enjoy watching videos over NDN on the
<a href='https://ivisa.named-data.net'>project's website</a>.</p>
