<p>I am a software engineer at Google where I work with GCP team. Before joining Google, I did my Ph.D. in computer science
at the University of Arizona under the supervision of <a href="https://www2.cs.arizona.edu/~bzhang">Prof. Beichuan Zhang</a>.
My research interests mainly include wide-area networks, routing and forwading protocols,
and future internet architecture (e.g., <a href="https://named-data.net">Named-Data Networking</a>).
You can see the list of my Ph.D. projects <a class="link" href="{{ site.url }}/projects">here</a>.</p>
